This is the moment when your patients decide three things: whether to trust you through their screen, whether to trust the process, and whether to trust themselves to try something new that may make them feel vulnerable—all while being physically distant from you. The foundation you build in this first session determines the success of everything that follows. So let\\'s make sure you\\'re fully prepared.\\nOne of your first tasks is helping patients create an effective space for virtual sessions. Guide them toward a comfortable space with these three essential elements: quality audio, good lighting, and privacy. Don\\'t require them to purchase specific equipment—work with what they have. Don\\'t insist that sessions take place in the same room, and definitely don\\'t suggest public spaces. Your patients need to feel safe to be vulnerable, and that requires privacy in their own environment.\\nDuring Session 1, participants often share deeply personal information. When someone says something like \"I just want to stop feeling so anxious all the time,\" how you respond matters enormously. Your instinct might be to immediately offer solutions or reassurance. Remember to resist that urge. Instead, validate their courage first.\\nAn appropriate response would be: \"Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to name what we\\'re struggling with, especially in a virtual format.\" This response does three things: it honors their vulnerability, it acknowledges the unique challenge of opening up through a screen, and it builds the trust foundation that Session 1 is all about.\\nWhat you should NOT do is immediately jump to fixing the problem, change the subject to avoid discomfort, ask them to save personal sharing for later sessions, or redirect them to a medical professional unless there\\'s a genuine clinical concern.\\nWhen you explain the protocol to patients, tone matters as much as your content. Be logical and evidence-based, not mystical or overly complex. This protocol is grounded in neuroscience, psychology, and music therapy research—present it that way. Your patients don\\'t need dramatic urgency or mystical intrigue. They need to understand why this approach works. Build trust in the process.\\nThe pre-shot routine is something you co-create with each patient. It\\'s not a script you hand them—it\\'s personalized to their unique experiences. The routine includes five elements:\\n1. Physical centering — a position that grounds their body\\n2. Attention focusing — directing their mental attention\\n3. Breathing preparation — initial breath awareness\\n4. Intention setting — clarifying their purpose for this practice\\n5. Transition cue — the signal that moves them into the music listening phase\\nThe pre-shot routine is a variation of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. This concept is similar to how memory is triggered by music. Here\\'s how it works: you can train your brain to recall a specific feeling or memory by repeating a ritualistic movement. With repetition, you can recall a specific emotional state on demand simply by repeating the routine.\\nIn the protocol, you\\'ll teach your patients how to use the pre-shot routine concept to prepare them to get the maximum benefit when practicing the breathing and listening exercises. Whatever movement they create as their pre-shot routine should feel natural to them—not imposed by you.\\nWhen helping patients select their first songs, there\\'s one thing you must absolutely avoid: judging their choices or imposing your preferences. Your role is to consider their audio setup quality, balance their personal preferences with regulation principles, explore how different genres may support their emotional goals, and discuss how they\\'ll access music for daily practice.\\nThe music they choose is theirs—even if you wouldn\\'t choose that song, even if it\\'s not what other patients typically select. Honor their choice. You need to emphasize that their personal connection to whatever music they choose is a big part of why the process works. Their connection to the music is what makes the protocol powerful for regulation.\\nDuring Session 1, you\\'ll guide patients through their first practice of the protocol. How you frame this experience shapes everything that follows. Success in this first practice is NOT about perfect technique. Frame it as exploration and data gathering.\\nUse language like this: \"This first practice is about exploration. Notice what happens to your mind and body when you practice. What feels natural? What feels awkward? What surprises you? Remember, there\\'s no wrong way to do this.\"\\nUsing this language removes performance pressure and opens space for genuine discovery. Your patients aren\\'t being tested—they\\'re beginning a journey to learn how to find peace and balance whenever they need it.\\nWhen you assign daily homework, how you frame it matters more than what you assign. Don\\'t present homework as mandatory requirements with consequences. Don\\'t frame it as a test of their commitment or competition with other participants. And definitely don\\'t make it sound like a medical prescription.\\nInstead, frame it as exploration and data gathering. Try using this phrase: \"This week you\\'re gathering data about your own responses to the protocol in your personal space. Notice what works, what doesn\\'t, and what feels different at different times of day. You\\'re the researcher studying yourself to learn more about yourself.\"\\nAnd here\\'s something critical: when patients miss practice days and are feeling they failed, help reframe their opinion. If you say \"Missed days are actually an opportunity for you to learn, not another problem for you to solve,\" you are really reframing their perception of their behavior.\\nContinuing on, if you say \"Missed days actually provide you with valuable information,\" you can see this reframing. By framing comments this way, you\\'re telling them: a missed day doesn\\'t mean you\\'re not ready for the program, a missed day doesn\\'t require you to make up work, a missed day doesn\\'t need to be recorded as a concern, and it definitely doesn\\'t mean that you have to start over.\\nA good way to examine the reasons why they didn\\'t practice would be to ask: \"So you didn\\'t practice Tuesday. Tell me, what was happening in your life that day?\" By getting them to examine how and why a day of practice was missed tells us a lot. It tells us something about when the protocol fits into their life and when it doesn\\'t.\\nYou\\'ll be providing patients with resources to use between sessions. Present these as extended support and practice companions—not as additional homework that increases their workload. These aren\\'t optional extras only for highly motivated participants. They\\'re not backup plans in case telehealth sessions get cancelled. And they\\'re definitely not assessment tools to measure progress.\\nPosition them like this: \"These resources are here to support your practice between our sessions. Think of them as companions on your journey. Use what helps, skip what doesn\\'t.\"\\nLet me leave you with the most important thing: your mindset. Session 1 success doesn\\'t come from demonstrating your expertise or impressing patients with your knowledge. It doesn\\'t come from strict adherence to the protocol without flexibility. And it definitely doesn\\'t come from emphasizing the limitations of virtual delivery.\\nWhat matters is this: trust the telehealth process, trust your patients\\' ability to engage meaningfully from their own spaces, and let genuine care guide every virtual interaction. Your steady, caring presence—even through a screen—creates the safety patients need to begin this vulnerable work. That\\'s what Session 1 is really about.\\nIn Session 2, your patients will come back having tried the protocol on their own for the first time. They\\'ll be vulnerable and uncertain. You\\'ll be ready to meet them with the skills we\\'ll cover in the next training video.\\n— End of Transcript —' WHERE id = 3",
